The goal of WhiteStone was to create an affordable alternative to in person oral care and consultation using machine learning. Providing oral health diagnosis and recommendations for those with a lower income. WhiteStone was created with the premise of "how can we create a service with Ai to help those in need?"</div>
              <div class="body-text">This Project required a number of skills to be executed. My main role in the project came in the designing and front end implementation aspects of the app. This includes the use of figma for prototyping as well as adobe suite softwares to develop the style of the app.</div>
              <div class="body-text">In November 2023 the project was presented at the BCIT Telus theatre to the mayor of Burnaby as well as other esteemed guests.</div>
