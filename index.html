          <div class="body-text">The most recent project is WhiteStone. The objective of WhiteStone was to establish an affordable alternative to in-person oral care and consultation through the application of machine learning. It aimed to offer oral health diagnosis and recommendations for individuals with a lower income. The project began with the question, "How can a service with AI be created to assist those in need?"</div>
          <div class="body-text">The execution of this project demanded a range of skills. The primary role undertaken in the project involved the design and front-end implementation aspects of the app. This encompassed the utilization of Figma for prototyping and Adobe Suite software for developing the app's style.</div>
          <div class="body-text">In November 2023, the project was presented at the BCIT Telus Theatre to the mayor of
            Burnaby as well as other esteemed guests.</div>

          <div class="body-text">Significant emphasis in Ecoture was placed on front-end design. Figma was employed for prototyping early designs, and Adobe Suite software was used to generate design assets for the project.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Ultimately, the project required various user tests to evaluate the responses users might experience while utilizing the app. The result provided a user-friendly and inviting UI/UX for the project.</div>
