            <div class="tab-content">After the final stage of app prototyping it came time to translate it into code.

            <div class="tab-content">Once the app had reached a certain level of functionality it came time for user testing to determine if the app flowed nicely. The testing involved five individuals that went through the app and would be questioned at each point of the test about the apps functionality, design, concept, and accessibility. Afterwards the tester would be questioned on their overall experiance and if there was any changes they would recommend. A majority of tester had a postive experiance using that app which proved it was in it's final stages
