        <div class="subheader-text">Problem</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Whitestone addresses the issue of limited access to timely and comprehensive dental health information. Many individuals face challenges in monitoring and understanding their dental well-being, often leading to neglected oral health. Traditional dental checkups are sporadic, and individuals may not be aware of subtle changes in their oral condition. This lack of awareness can result in delayed treatment and the escalation of dental problems. To bridge this gap, Whitestone was created as an innovative solution to help users with real-time insights into their dental health through a convenient and user-friendly mobile application.</div>

        <div class="subheader-text">Challenge</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The primary challenge in designing Whitestone was to create a robust system that could accurately scan and analyze users' teeth to provide meaningful and reliable dental health information. This included developing a user interface that seamlessly integrates with the teeth scanning technology, ensuring simplicity for users while maintaining the precision required for dental diagnostics. The application needed to be user-friendly, ensuring that individuals with varying technological proficiency could easily navigate through the app and interpret their dental health results.</div>

        <div class="subheader-text">In The Beginning</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">It began with a rough idea of what an accessible tooth scanner might look like. During the prototyping process, the main goal was to create an experience that was streamlined and intuitive for users to pull out and use regularly. Making sure information was easily scannable and presented in a way that was suitable for all demographics.</div>

        <div class="subheader-text">Honing In</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">As the design process progressed, accessibility became an aspect that began to be implemented, as well as sharpening the style of the app. With accessibility in mind, a dark mode version of the app was implemented, allowing users to have the option to choose what experience suited them best.</div>

        <div class="subheader-text">Setting The Style</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">With confidence in our app structure, it was time to solidify the style. The decision to theme the app around purple comes from its roots as a color that represents calmness, relaxation, and healing. This idea is also supported by purple having a background in the medical space, giving the app a clean and comfortable feel.</div>

        <div class="subheader-text">Preparing The Final Design</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Now that the style was ready to implement, the creation of the components for the app layout began. This process made it simple to add and tweak aspects of the app's design all in one place. The addition of multiple colorways was made for user testing purposes.</div>

        <div class="subheader-text">User Testing</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Before committing to the front-end code, user testing had to take place. Purple was the color that seemed optimal for the app's design, but three other color combinations were tested by eight testers first to confirm it. The users walked through the app and gave us feedback on what worked accessibility and visually-wise. After testing all 3 colorways, including the original, users felt the purple in the initial design was the best fit.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">After confirmation from multiple testers that the app was in the best state it could be, it was time to round out the final design to implement on the front end. Every choice for our final design came from hours of research on what would be the most accessible and smooth experience for users. </div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Whitestone's design is rooted in a user-centric approach, balancing functionality with an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface. The user interface was crafted with simplicity in mind, featuring clear and concise visuals to convey complex dental information in an easily digestible format. The color scheme and imagery were chosen to evoke a sense of trust and medical professionalism, creating a positive user experience.</div>
