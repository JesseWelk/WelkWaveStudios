        <div class="subheader-text">Problem</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Whitestone addresses the issue of limited access to timely and comprehensive dental health information. Many individuals face challenges in monitoring and understanding their dental well-being, often leading to neglected oral health. Traditional dental checkups are sporadic, and individuals may not be aware of subtle changes in their oral condition. This lack of awareness can result in delayed treatment and escalation of dental problems. To bridge this gap, Whitestone was conceptualized as an innovative solution to empower users with real-time insights into their dental health through a convenient and user-friendly mobile application.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The primary challenge in designing Whitestone was to create a robust system that could accurately scan and analyze users' teeth to provide meaningful and reliable dental health information. The client's requirements included developing a user interface that seamlessly integrates with the teeth scanning technology, ensuring simplicity for users while maintaining the precision required for dental diagnostics. The application needed to be user-friendly, ensuring that individuals with varying levels of technological proficiency could easily navigate through the app and interpret their dental health results.</div>

        <div class="subheader-text">In The Beginning</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">It began with a rough idea of what an accessible teeth scanner might look like. During the prototyping processes, the main goal was to create an experiance that was streamlined and intuitive for users to pull out and use on a regular basis. Making sure information was easily scannable and presented in a way that is suitable for all demographics.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">As the design process progressed, accessiblity became an aspect that began to be implemented, as well as sharpening the style of the app. With accessiblity in mind, a dark mode version of the app was implemented, allowing users to have the option to choose what experiance suited them best.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">With confidence in our app structure, It was time to solidify the style. The decision to theme the app around purple comes from it's roots in being a color that represents calmness, relaxtion and healing. This idea is also supported by purple having a background in the medical space, giving the app a clean and comfortable feel.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Now that the style was ready to implement, the creation of the components for the app layout began. This process made it simple to add and tweak aspects of the apps design all in one place. The addition of multiple colorways was made for User testing purposes.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Before commiting to the front end code, user testing had to take place. Purple was the color that seemed optimal for the apps design, but three other color ways were tested by 8 testers first to confirm it. The Users walked through the app and gave us feedback on what worked accessiblity and visually wise. After testing all 3 color ways including the original, users felt the purple in the inital design was the best fit.</div>

          <div class="body-text">After confirmation from mulitple testers that the app was in the best state it could be, it was time to round out the final design to implement in the front end.
